A quick rundown of the system:

cortex.py:
  Main script that starts up the whole system.

admin.py:
  Simple command interface used to send commands to the system over RPC.


Data       -- The external data that we want to monitor for updates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Registry   -- Handles distibution of ports, and name:port mappings of servers
RPCServer  -- Fairly self-explanatory.  Calls to the Controller for handling.
Controller -- Interprets commands from RPC, and handles the managers and depot.
Readers    -- Generic interfaces for retrieving various types of data.
Managers   -- Use 1 or more readers to retrieve data and pass it to a depot.
Depot      -- Receives and stores data.
View       -- Presents data from the store to the user.


Misc:
  Registry runs on port 9047, and distributes ports to Cortex systems
