A quick rundown of the system:

cortex.py:
  Main script that starts up the whole system.

util.py:
  Used to send commands to the system over RPC.
    use "util.py kill" to shut down.


Data       -- The external data that we want to monitor for updates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RPCServer  -- Fairly self-explanitory.  Calls to the Controller for handling.
Controller -- Interprets commands from RPC, and handles the managers and depot.
Readers    -- Generic interfaces for retrieving various types of data.
Managers   -- Use 1 or more readers to retrieve data and pass it to a depot.
Depot      -- Recieves and stores data.
View       -- Presents data from the store to the user.
